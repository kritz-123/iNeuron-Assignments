Relationship between mean,median,mode in right skew(+ve skew)
mean>median>mode

eg: From right skew graph as we can see most frequent data lies in left side that
will be mode value (extreme left)(quick glance through graph)

This can be seen through considering data set as well
class interval[0-10, 10-20,20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70]
frequency[5,15,40,25,20,10,5]
upon calculation
mean= 32.5  median= 30  mode=26.5


Relationship between mean,median,mode in left skew(+ve skew)
mean<median<mode

eg: From left skew graph most frequent data lies in extreme right hence mode 
value is at extreme right greater value (quick glance through graph)

This can be seen through considering data set as well
class interval[0-10, 10-20,20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70]
frequency[5,10,20,25,40,15,5]
mean= 37.5 median= 40  mode=43.5
